        <h1>Privacy Policy for Keep Active Extension</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: [01/03/2024]</p>

        <h2>Permissions and Why They Are Needed</h2>
        <p><strong>Tabs:</strong> The 'tabs' permission is required to manage browser tabs. This includes actions like opening a new tab or refreshing an existing one to keep the session active.</p>
        <p><strong>Alarms:</strong> The 'alarms' permission is used to schedule code to run periodically. This is necessary for the extension to trigger actions, like refreshing a page, at the set intervals.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage:</strong> The 'storage' permission allows the extension to save settings and preferences locally on your device. This ensures your settings are persistent across browser sessions.</p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, use, store, or share any personal information from the users of our Extension. Our Extension operates completely locally on your device, and no data is transmitted off your device in relation to the services provided by the Extension.</p>

        <h2>Information Usage</h2>
        <p>Since our Extension does not collect any personal data, there is no usage of user data to describe.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Selling</h2>
        <p>We do not share or sell any personal information because we do not collect any. The Extension does not transmit any information to us or third parties.</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>As no data is collected, there is no risk of breach of your personal information with respect to the use of our Extension.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical, or business developments. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.</p>

        <p>By using the Keep Active Extension, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
